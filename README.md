**Bank Churn Analysis**
Overview
This project involves analyzing customer churn data for a bank to uncover key insights and help reduce churn rates. The process includes data cleaning, database management, query writing, and data visualization. The analysis was conducted using Excel, MySQL, and Power BI, resulting in an interactive dashboard for comprehensive visualization and insights.



**Project Description**
The project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to identify factors contributing to customer churn. The steps involved in this project are:
Collecting raw data from various Excel files.
Cleaning the data for accuracy and consistency.
Importing the cleaned data into MySQL.
Writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
Importing the SQL tables into Power BI.
Creating an interactive dashboard for visualization and insights.


**Data Cleaning**
The raw data from various Excel files needed cleaning to ensure reliability. The following steps were performed:
Removing Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
Handling Missing Values: Addressed missing values by filling them appropriately or excluding them based on the context.
Standardizing Data Formats: Ensured consistency in data formats such as dates, numerical values, and categories.


**Database Management**
The cleaned data was imported into MySQL for efficient management and analysis. The following steps were taken:
Table Creation: Created tables in MySQL to store the cleaned data.
Data Import: The cleaned data was imported into the MySQL tables.
Indexing: Indexed key columns to optimize query performance.

**Data Analysis**
SQL queries were written to analyze the data and extract insights. Key analysis areas included:
Customer Demographics: Analyzing demographic data to identify patterns and trends.
Account Information: Examining account-related information to understand customer behavior.
Credit Score Analysis: Investigating credit score patterns to identify high-risk churn groups.
Churn Factors: Identifying factors that contribute to customer churn.


**Insights and Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, the following insights and recommendations were made:
High-Risk Demographics: Identified specific demographic groups with higher churn rates, suggesting targeted retention strategies.
Account Features: Recommended adjustments to account features that are correlated with high churn rates.
Credit Score Monitoring: Suggested closer monitoring of credit score patterns to identify and address churn risks early.
Customer Engagement: Emphasized the need for enhanced customer engagement initiatives for identified high-risk groups.
